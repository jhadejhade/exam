# Task Requirements:

Your task is to create a football information app supporting the following requirements:
* A splash screen will be shown when the app is launched. Use whatever image you want for the splash screen.
* The app’s main screen will show a list of football teams. When a team is selected, the app will show:
* The team’s logo
* Names of players in the team
* A list of 10 (or fewer) upcoming matches for the team. You should show the name of the rival team, the date, and the competition (Champions League, Primera Division, etc.).
* Each of the above should be shown in its own View, but all should be visible in the main screen. Use scrollbars if needed.

* For this exercise, you should implement the app in Swift.
* Football information is available from https://www.football-data.org/.

# Design / implementation guidelines
1. You can use whichever packages/components you want.
2. You do not have to write tests.
3. Pay attention to clean code.
Good luck!

# Note:
I have added a filter call in the details page since most of the teams don't have any upcoming matches, just so you can check how the ui looks like (choose Finished for results).

# How to test:
* Open .xcworkspace
* run on either simulator or a real device
* Works on iOS 13 and up
